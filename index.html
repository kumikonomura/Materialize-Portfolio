                <div class="col s6">
                    <p>Hi my name is Kumiko. I graduated from the University of La Verne in 2017 with a Bachelor of
                        Science
                        in Accounting. I currently work as an accountant. My job involves a lot of analyzing,
                        reconciling, and
                        solving
                        financial problems. It's hard work but there are aspects to it that I like. One of the best
                        feelings is
                        able to
                        figure out a complex financial puzzle.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of my favorite hobbies are exercising, reading, cooking,
                        playing music, and traveling. When it comes to exercising I like to
                        run, swim, play basketball, and more. As long as it's a challenge, it's something I enjoy.
                        Reading
                        has been a passion of mine since youth. Some of my favorite books include
                        Oliver Twist, The Great Gatsby, and 1984. I love the classics, but also any good mystery or
                        fantasy
                        book. Music has been a part of my life since I was little.
                        I started playing piano when I was six years old and my fond of music grew from that. Lastly,
                        traveling is one my favorite things to do. I love experiencing new cultures, food,
                        people, and historic landmarks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I think this course will help me grow professionally and enable me with a good set of skills.
                        I'm hoping
                        to get into a job position
                        where both my financial background and new coding skills will be utilized.
